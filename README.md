## Code

- `BF3S` is the original code base for the Boosting paper, which only has code for cosine classifier [1]

- `BF3S_proto` has been adapted to run ProtoNet

- `BF3S_modified_model_1.0_2nets` is the code for Modified Model 1.0

- `BF3S_modified_model_2.0_2nets` is the code for Modified Model 2.0

- `protoNet` is the code for a reproduced prototypical network [2]
